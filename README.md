This plugin uses a fork of [HiberniaDiscord](https://github.com/ParadauxIO/Conch/) for it's discord bot.

DiscordChat is a lightweight and modular Discord bridge allowing you to syncronise in-game messages in Minecraft with a channel on your discord via discord-webhooks and an integrated discord bot.<br>
Users will appear as "bots" with their player head as the avatar.<br>
Using the Integrated Discord Bot you can configure discord messages to appear in game.

Designated discord roles can use commands from the Discord chat through the console.
